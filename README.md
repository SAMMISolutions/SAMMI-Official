## What is SAMMI?
SAMMI is a fully customizable Stream Deck that lets your Twitch and YouTube Live audience control and interact with your stream.
It is fully compatible with [OBS Websocket](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/), which can remotely control your [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).  
SAMMI can listen to Twitch alerts and chat messages, send chat messages, and fully control your Twitch stream via the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference).  
It also works for YouTube streams too - it can listen to all chat events, send chat messages, and ban users, to name a few.
